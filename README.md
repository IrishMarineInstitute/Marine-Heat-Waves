# Marine-Heat-Waves

This project is an uWSGI-Nginx-Flask web application that provides rapid access to Marine Heat Waves (MHW) analysis over an area of interest. After the application is deployed, the user can select a point on a map and obtain the time series of Sea Surface Temperature (SST) at the selected site, together with the climatological values and an anaysis of the occurrence of MHW. This information is presented using an interactive figure with a slider that allows the user to select different years in the time series. See figure below for an example:
